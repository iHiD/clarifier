      "this program is a presentation of you\nseek levy for educational and non-commercial\nuse only to the university of california davis\nhouses since nineteen seventy three continuing\nmedical education has been a interval part educational\nmission u_c_ davis school of medicine and medical center the center for health and technology sixteen increases access to health education and\npromotes interaction patients other health care here patients and enrich school nurse alumni association dot\nshared bioethics at u_c_ davis and the topic that we will be\nconsidering is proud of options of last resort recent developments and emerging trends nothing to disclose simulation to this\npresentation the relief of pain and suffering is the essence palliative care we're going to be looking at the physician's responsibility to patients who are at or near the end end of their life and in the seminal article in the new\nengland journal in nineteen eighty nine a distinguished group of physicians\nposed the fundamental question what is the\nphysician's responsibility towards hopelessly ill patients we're going to look at some very\ncomplicated issue such as is there such a thing as intractable\npain or suffering at the end of life and can we be so bold as to actually distinguish between physical and psychological shel or sometimes called existential suffering\nat the end of life and if we're able to do that in a conscientious and consistent way ought we to be responding too goes different forms of suffering in different ways out both literally and figuratively one can\nsay that the physician eric cassell has written the book on suffering and there are two statements that he's\nmade on this subject that i think we should begin with first of all he notes transiently bodies do not suffer suffer and the implication of that is if we\nfocus obsessively on the physiology of the and we miss the personal engagement with\nthe patient then we cannot even recognize eyes let alone begin to treat suffering he goes on to say that the essence of\nsuffering is that it it curves when there is no\nimpending destruction of the person perceived or experienced and suffering continues until his past or the integrity of the person can be\nrestored and some of the matter this is from his definitive nineteen ninety-one work the nature of suffering and the goals of\nmedicine so the overarching ethical question with\nwhich we will grapple in this presentation is what what\nmeasures fall within the range of ethically acceptable palette of options of last resort with which conditions can respond to the suffering of patience at the end of life and i would say as an additional point we're not just talking about palliative medicine experts or hospice\npositions we're talking about the responsibility\nof all physicians who are likely to come into contact with\npatients who are at or near the end of the airline there are some learning objectives for\nthis presentation which i will review it this time at the end of the session you should be\nable to distinguish among the varieties of euthanasia and their respective levels of ethical\nacceptance identify the essential elements of notions as the doctrine of double a fact slippery slope arguments and discuss their relevance to end of life care you should be able to explain the\nholdings in the u_s_ supreme court indeed a definitive cases on physician-assisted\nsuicide quill and barco and their implications for physician assisted suicide or as some\nchoose to characterize it path physician-assisted dying as well as palliative sedation you should be able to state the requirements of the oregon\ndeath with dignity act and the significance of another u_s_\nsupreme court ruling in the case of gonzalez against oregon be able to describe the nature of the\ndata on the ten years sort of experience that we have with your even death with dignity act defined powder sedation and delineate\nthe guidelines for providing it and analyzed from unethical and a\nprofessional perspective your own view of the legitimate parameters for care of patients with intractable\nsuffering at the end of life article is i cited previously i'll refer to again because they and a very concise and didactic fashion make two important statements first the proper dose of pain medication is the dose that is sufficient to relieve pain and suffering and secondly to allow a patient to experience under arable pain or suffering is unethical medical practice returning to erica cells clinics are suffering and goals of\nmedicine heat essentially issues sir more of an indictment in just a\nchallenge medical colleagues he says the test of a\nsystem of medicine tributes adequacy in the face of suffering modern medicine he charges fails that test indeed goes on to say the central\nassumptions on which twentieth-century medicine is\nfound provide no basis for an understanding of suffering uh... what might he mean by that this is simply a reiteration of what i'd\nbegan with reiterated because of its critical\nimportance and relevance to much of what i will be saying in the next sixty minutes who sells is if we're to understand",

      "this week we're going to talk about reno\nphysiology cell reno is active ny physiology that study of the uh... the function of kidneys and we're gonna talk mainly about how\nthey work when they're working correctly and what pontoons they perform in uh...\nin the body and are you probably know that their important but hopefully by the end lecture today\ndon't know exactly why they are so important for your overall a state of\nhelp and uh... and you you'd you won't live\nvery long without near normal kidney function and their the reading on this is chapter\nnine section we'll talk about the biomedical\nengineering innovation that over the last up if you're sixty\nyears or so it's really changed ob changed out the quality and duration\nof life for patients that have kidney disease and that kidney dialysis or renal dialysis so we'll talk about\nthat on thursday afternoon so this is just in an outline of the\nthings are going to cover uh... during that during the lecture\ntoday and on thursday we're going to talk about search\nsyringes gross aspects of the urinary system the kidney the bladder and the tubes that connects that these\nthings i'll talk a little bit about the\ndifferences between plasma plasma is the fluid circulates in your body and we thought about circulation of\nfluids in the body the week before spring break we talked about the heart and the blood\nvessels and uh... and the blood and so that main fluid of interest there was\nplasma this this fluid that blood cells circulated the main fluid will be interested in in\nreopens the ology as urine and this is a fluid that's produced by\nthe kidneys stored in the bladder next created from the body as one of the primary mechanisms that\nyour body has for getting rid of waste and regulating the composition of fluids\nlike plasma uh... and what up like a little bit more about that in just a second opted to deter understand how it works\nwill talk about the anatomy of the kidney on the gross level and on the\nmicroscopic level has an amazingly sophisticated\norganization which is critical for its function so if you understand the anatomy of that i can you understand a lot about\nhow it works and then we'll talk about specifics\nabout how you're in is created in the kidney and processed and and\num... it turns out that all of these processes are important for maintaining your health and as i\nmentioned we'll talk lastly about about dialysis which is a uh... extraordinarily effective but not quite perfect means uh... for for ab keeping people that\nhave kidney failure in good health so show you a picture like this may be\nexactly this picture a picture like this before but this is sort of a a aid at block diagram r engineering\nview of the human body and so you can see the outside world is\nthe things that surround this red and blue label box and the inside of the body is inside we talked last time we were here we\ntalked about the circulatory system and so this mechanism\nfor circulating fluids around in the body and we talked about how that works and why that's so\nimportant you'll remember that when we talked\nabout dud nervous system which which controls a lot of body\nfunctions we talked about both in the nervous system in the\ncardiovascular system how important certain tie-ins were for the function of those cells in\nparticular we talked about sodium and potassium sodium and potassium which are present\nin the case of sodium at high concentration outside of sells low\nconcentration inside cast in the reverse high concentration\ninside low concentration outside in order to those cells to function for a nerve sell to send a signal down\nan exxon or four cardiac muscle cell to contract those concentrations of ian's have to be\npresent and they have to be the way that i described you have to\nhave height extracellular sodium low intercellular it high intracellular potassium low\nextracellular so yes your cellular potassium levels are not\ncorrect you can't make an action potential in\nthe way that we described before part doesn't the brains can send signals so all of that busy elegy we talked\nabout in the nervous system and the heart depends on having i am concentrations in your body at the\ncorrect level so how is that maintained well one way\nyou could make a good think about it you have a box like this if this is your\nbody you can think about maintaining it by\njust knowing exactly how much sodium and potassium to eat everyday so you always\nkeep the right now you're going to lose some you lose some\nfluids so if you knew exactly how much to eat you could regulate concentration that\nway but that would be that's difficult to do right and we can you know we don't\ndo that we eat and general excess sodium and excess potassium so somehow our body is keeping these concentrations\nat the right level how does it do that well that's really the main function of\nthe kidney the main function the kidney is two\ncents how much sodium and potassium there is\nin your body and then to extract the amount that's\nnot needed in order to maintain the levels at the\nconstant concentration that's needed so was the main function of the urinary",

      "this is is going to be a terrific case this is what i love when you see a\nwhole bunch of things in use little algorithms to quickly\nidentify what you're at this movie is called muscle there are three kinds of muscle\nhistologically there is muscle without strays shins so\nthat's called smooth muscle there are two types of muscle with strange chins and if the fibers are arranged parallel their car that's called skeletal or\nvoluntary striated muscle the striated muscle has fibers which\nintern connect with each other as a mesh that's\ncalled cardiac muscle in this field we have all three kinds of\nmuscle let's go to the first one on the left and let's assume that up a little bit and you could quickly see i hope that's these fibers here are clearly striated in addition they are arranged very longitudinally\nleg logs underneath the steps fireplace in addition you could see that the nuclei at all out\nto get the periphery so this is classical voluntary skeletal strated muscle technically if you cut one of these nuclei change in\nchile uh... with respect to the fiber it might\nlook like it was in the middle of the fiber but in reality that's just a geometric\narafat in true voluntary skeletal strated muscle the nuclear all at the periphery you can identify destroying shins better from doing longitudinal cuts with respect to the axis of the fiber you can identify where the nuclei are\nbetter by doing across or axial sections with respect to it this as classical striated skeletal muscle let's move on to the next piece of\ntissue here are muscle fibers in which you can\nclearly see there are no stratagene ds and in addition denuclearize are kinda like cigar shaped if you cut them longitudinally they look\na little bit like bent cigars if you happen to cut them more transversely\nwhat you see here they look around so once again it's a geometric\nphenomenon the if you were looking at nd smooth\nmuscle fibers which have been cut transfers for their longitudinal axis don't look like they're around if you cut them longitudinal because they're longitudinal access they\nwill look like a little cigars are very very spends lee quite frankly you can have a very hard\ntime differentiating this from connective tissue perhaps dense regular\nor irregular connective tissue but if you get a trite chrome stain be cytoplasm of the fibroblasts mt collagen fibres\nstay very clearly blue or greenish blue i want to try to come staying where a\nsmooth muscle would not pick up the greenish at all let's keep on moving away now from these\nnice smooth muscle fibers and grow and to our\nthird type of muscle which we are going to be seeing very\nvery soon an sure we have just landed ah... and\nthe uh... coast here in which there to see some muscle fibers now in which it i think you will unpaid meant it's a\nlittle bit more difficult to see the strangeness on this perhaps i could convince you very soon then it took let's go to a different area maybe we'll\nsee some strangulation spinner perhaps i could convince you then if you look very closely let's hear\nor perhaps here former political another place if you can see a\ngood just take a quick visit to another place if you look perhaps hopefully i can convince you that these are\nstraying shins are also blush two things separates us from skeletal voluntary striated muscle whereas i think i could convince you\nthat may be sir some strange names the nuclei are clearly within the center\nof the flavor like here but here is like here click here like\npractically everywhere and in addition the fibers are not\nstepped up nicely leg logs on the fireplace they've ranch and thirdly you'll have it and abundance of areas in which you can see little lines in the middle of to connecting fibers\nlike perhaps here like certainly here like certainly hear and these are your\nintercalated disks so cardiac muscle is also striated not nicely australia skeletal muscle but\nit has the nuclei in the middle of the fiber it hasn't urkel ada desks defy bridge bridge to connect with the\njason fibers because the method of contraction is not linear it's in\nmultiple dimensions and last but not least the fiber is not quite anesthetic is the osco skeletal muscle voluntary strated\nfiber they're a little bit smaller so there we are all three types of muscle and one nice\nslide and i hope that home i can convince you that there is no\npossible way you could ever confuse striated from skeletal from cardiac muscle for the rest of your life and i thank you very much",
